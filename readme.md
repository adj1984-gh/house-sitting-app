3. **Admin can edit/delete** stays as needed
4. **Outside active stay** → Shows "No active stay" message
5. **Inside active stay** → Shows stay details normally

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Stays table
CREATE TABLE stays (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  property_id UUID REFERENCES properties(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sitter_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,

## 🔧 Recent Fixes & Improvements (December 2024)

### ✅ Stay Creation System Fixed
- **Issue**: Stay creation was failing with "Supabase admin not configured" errors
- **Root Cause**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-side only, not accessible in client-side code
- **Solution**: Created server-side API routes (`/api/stays`) for all stay operations
- **Result**: Stay creation, editing, and deletion now work perfectly

### ✅ Session Persistence Added
- **Issue**: Users had to re-enter passwords on every page refresh
- **Solution**: Implemented localStorage-based session persistence
- **Features**:
  - Main authentication persists across refreshes
  - Admin mode persists across refreshes
  - Easy switching between sitter and admin views
  - Proper logout functionality clears all sessions

### ✅ Accessibility Improvements
- **Issue**: Colorblind users couldn't distinguish alert importance levels
- **Solution**: Added emoji symbols to alerts:
  - 🚨 **Danger alerts** (critical/safety issues)
  - ⚠️ **Warning alerts** (important notices)
  - ℹ️ **Info alerts** (general information)
- **Result**: Clear visual hierarchy independent of color perception

### ✅ Admin Access Control Enhanced
- **Issue**: Admin mode was gated by stay status, limiting functionality
- **Solution**: Modified access control to allow admins full access regardless of stay status
- **Result**: Admins can manage all data even when no active stay exists

### 🧪 Database Testing & Verification
- **Created comprehensive SQL test scripts** to verify database setup
- **Confirmed database schema** is properly configured
- **Verified manual stay creation** works correctly
- **All database constraints and relationships** are functioning properly

### 📁 New Files Added
- `app/api/stays/route.ts` - Server-side API routes for stay operations
- `test-database.sql` - Database testing and verification scripts
- `cleanup-test-data.sql` - Test data cleanup script


### ✅ Photo Upload Fix (December 2024)
- **Issue**: Photo upload failing with "Could not find the 'birthdate' column" error
- **Root Cause**: Database schema missing `birthdate` column that TypeScript interface expected
- **Solution**: Added `birthdate DATE` column to dogs table schema and created migration script
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `lib/database-setup.sql` - Added birthdate column to dogs table
  - `migration-add-birthdate.sql` - Migration script for existing databases
- **Result**: Photo upload and dog editing now work correctly

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements (December 2024)
- **Photo Display**: Fixed dog photos to display properly on summary page instead of emoji
- **Close Button**: Added X close button to all edit popup forms for better UX
- **Unsaved Changes Warning**: Added confirmation prompt when closing forms with unsaved changes
- **Form State Management**: Improved form state tracking to prevent accidental data loss
- **Stay Filtering**: Fixed Overview page to show appropriate stays based on user role
  - **Sitter view**: Shows only current active stay
  - **Admin view**: Shows current + upcoming stays by default, with toggle for past stays
  - **Smart toggle**: "Show Past (X)" button appears only when past stays exist
  - **Scrollable list**: Auto-scrollable when showing all stays with many entries
  - **Clean interface**: Prevents overwhelming display of 20-30+ stays
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `components/HouseSittingApp.tsx` - Enhanced modal UI, form state management, and stay filtering
  - `lib/database.ts` - Added getCurrentActiveStay function for better stay management
- **Result**: Better user experience with proper photo display, form safety features, and role-appropriate stay display

### ✅ Form-View Data Mapping Fix (December 2024)
- **Issue**: Disconnect between special instructions form structure and view display
- **General Walk Notes**: Removed redundant general walk notes field, now only individual scheduled walk notes are shown
- **Special Instructions**: Fixed form-to-view mapping to properly display custom type/instruction pairs
- **Data Structure**: Special instructions now dynamically display all form entries instead of hardcoded keys
- **Sleeping Information**: Separated sleeping info into its own section for better organization
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `components/HouseSittingApp.tsx` - Fixed form display logic and removed general walk notes
  - `lib/database-setup.sql` - Removed walk_notes column from schema
  - `lib/types.ts` - Updated TypeScript interface
  - `migration-remove-walk-notes.sql` - Database migration script
- **Result**: Form data now properly translates to view display with clean, organized sections

### ✅ Medicine Notes Cleanup (December 2024)
- **Issue**: Standalone `medicine_notes` field was showing orphaned data alongside structured medicine schedule
- **Solution**: Removed display of standalone medicine_notes field, now only shows structured medicine_schedule entries
- **Enhanced Display**: Medicine schedule now shows individual notes for each medication entry
- **Database Cleanup**: Removed medicine_notes column from schema and created migration script
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `components/HouseSittingApp.tsx` - Removed standalone medicine_notes display
  - `lib/database-setup.sql` - Removed medicine_notes column from schema
  - `lib/types.ts` - Updated TypeScript interface
  - `migration-remove-medicine-notes.sql` - Database migration script
- **Result**: Clean medicine display with only structured schedule entries and their individual notes

### ✅ Time Input Format Fix (December 2024)
- **Issue**: HTML time input warnings due to 12-hour format values in 24-hour format fields
- **Problem**: `type="time"` inputs expect HH:mm format but were receiving "7:00 AM" format
- **Solution**: Changed time inputs to `type="text"` with placeholder examples for flexible time entry
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `components/HouseSittingApp.tsx` - Updated feeding time and appointment time inputs
- **Result**: No more browser warnings, flexible time entry format (7:00 AM, 2:00 PM, etc.)

### ✅ Welcome PDF Generation Feature (December 2024)
- **Feature**: Added PDF generation for sitter welcome documents with QR code auto-login
- **Implementation**: Server-side API route in Vercel for PDF generation
